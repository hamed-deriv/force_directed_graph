# Flutter Force-Directed Algorithm Simulation

## Overview

This Flutter project is an implementation of a Force-Directed Algorithm to simulate the behavior of
particles in a virtual environment.

### Key Features

- **Attractive Force to the Center**: Each particle is attracted to the center of the screen,
  creating a captivating central focal point.

- **Repulsive Forces Between Particles**: Particles naturally repel each other when they get too
  close, simulating the way real-world particles interact.

- **Attractive Edges**: The edges connecting particles exert an attractive force, ensuring that
  particles stay connected and move together as interconnected communities.
